**Object**

The goal of this assignment is to:
1. Create dynamic buttons for 10 topics I choose
1. Use those buttons to populate the page with 10 GIPHY images that are also clickable
1. Users can interact with the page by toggling the GIPHYs between active and static states
1. Users can also enter a term in the search engine that generates a new button, which in turn will call 10 GIPHYs based on that topic. These also toggle between static and active on click

***Technology used***

This pages utilizes HTML, CSS, AJAX, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. So far. 

I've managed to fulfill the assignement requirements, but the GIPHYs land on the page in a vertical row, which doesn't look all that great on a horizontal viewport. Now that I've created dynamic buttons and images, I'm going to explore a dynamic table or some other styling method to make my page more attractive.
